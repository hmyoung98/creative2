			<p>“Good morning gentlemen, please, come in. Have a seat.” The man who belonged to these words was about the same age as Captain Gremmert, though not quite as tall, but still taller than Robert or Ezekiel. He was not as large as Robert previously imagined, but was not lanky either.</p>
			<p>Unlike Gremmert, he left his chin bare, but kept a well-groomed mustache which spread from ear to ear. His round face was accentuated by his balding scalp, victim to the stressful life of commerce. Behind his spectacles were a pair of striking green eyes, which testified of the man’s experience and prowess.</p>
			<p>Gremmert motioned Robert to sit in the red velvet chair opposite the Master. As he sank into the cushion, a smell of pine and musk filled the vicinity.  Ezekiel pulled up a plain wooden chair, with slight ornamentation from against the wall and Gremmert sat in a short three-legged stool, which creaked as he poised himself on top.</p>
			<p>The Master sat down in his own chair behind his desk. It was neatly organized with ledgers to one side, and a few folders on the other, unlike Gremmert’s own. A pen and ink well were set on the front edge. Behind him was a large map of the world. A small silver pin marked the geographical location of Asterion on the map.</p>
			<p>Robert felt awkward in his old oversized clothes in a room where everything seemed so clean.</p>
			<p>The Master sat quietly for a moment, then his face lit up when he said, “Well, how was your voyage, Captain?“</p>
			<p>“Fairly smooth, until that storm passed over us last night.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, yes,” said the Master. “When it engulfed the island, it seemed it would become part of the sea itself. Although Asterion is protected by Alterra above us, it can’t keep us safe from rain falling sideways.” He was referring to the floating island which apparently only provides partial protection against the elements. “How did your crew fair? Everyone remain aboard?”</p>
			<p>“Fortunately, yes, but I can’t say the same for our young compatriot here.” Gremmert said, glancing at Robert with his eyes. Robert, however, was still looking at the mounted map, but locked eyes with the man across the desk as soon as his own mention was made.</p>
			<p>The Wharf Master looked apologetically toward the boy. “I’m sorry, son. You must feel terrible for the loss of your friends.”</p>
			<p>“Actually, sir,” Robert replied,” I can’t recall anything that happened before my rescue. If I had any friends, I wouldn’t be able to point them out in a crowd, nor name them.”</p>
			<p>“How unfortunate. But do you remember where you came from?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir”</p>
			<p>“What about why you were coming here?”</p>
			<p>“Still no.”</p>
			<p>“What about your name?”</p>
			<p>“Robert Vander, sir.”</p>
			<p>“That’s a relief. At least you still remember who you are.”</p>
			<p>“Not entirely, sir. Most things are still quite fuzzy."</p>
			<p>“Well, I hope things clear up after a while. I am pleased to meet you, Robert Vander. My name is Preston Chamberlain. I am the master of this wharf and all its functions, but you probably figured all that out by now.” His smile seemed full, but was hidden partly behind his mustache. He looked to Gremmert.</p>
			<p>“Thank you for your assistance Captain Gremmert. If it weren’t for you and your crew, this boy’s life would certainly have been lost.”</p>
			<p>Gremmert nodded and gave a half-smile. “We performed our duty as seamen. But what of the boy’s future? What is our next action?”</p>
			<p>Chamberlain looked quizzically at Gremmert. “Good question. Well, we should let him regain his strength, then figure out where he came from. But, until he gets his memory back, he will need a place to stay. Who knows how long that will take.”</p>
			<p>“I would be happy to take him on my ship as part of my crew,” replied Gremmert.</p>
			<p>“I appreciate the offer, but you are scheduled to depart tomorrow. Although it’s been several years since I have embarked on a voyage, I know the rigors of the sea well, and I guess it would not aid too well in young Mr. Vander’s recuperation.” He looked toward Robert who was almost falling asleep, “I would  suggest you stay here. You would stay in my home, and I would employ you as my apprentice. But, naturally, the choice is yours.”</p>
			<p>At this instance, everyone in the room was looking toward Robert, who, at Master Chamberlain’s offer, was noticeably more awake.</p>
			<p>“Well, what will it be, son? Which way do you go: land or sea?”</p>
			<p>For Robert, at this time, there were so many things passing through his mind, that it was difficult to keep focus. But, after some contemplation, he decided it would be better to take things easy, so he responded, “If it doesn’t interfere too much, I would like to stay here a while, and rest.” He then looked to Gremmert and his own caretaker, “I would love to go with you too. Maybe we could visit places that could jog my memory, but I must agree with Mr. Chamberlain that I am in no condition to go sailing.”</p>
			<p>Gremmert nodded to show his consent.</p>
			<p>“It’s settled then,” said the Master “Again, Captain Gremmert, I can’t thank you enough, and I am sure young Robert feels the same. Now, Robert you stay here, I have a few things to take care of before I can take you to my home. Captain, let me see you to the door.”</p>
			<p>At that, everyone stood up. Ezekiel replaced his chair against the wall, and they made their way to the door, but before they could get there, a knock came from the door.</p>
			<p>“Come in!” said Chamberlain.</p>
			<p>The door opened up, and a young, yet courageous voice came through.</p>
			<p>“Sorry, Papa, I didn’t know you would have visitors.”</p>
			<p>“It’s alright darling, we just finished here.”</p>
			<p>It was the Wharf Master’s daughter, his only child, roughly as old as Robert.</p>
			<p>“Good morning Miss Chamberlain,” said Gremmert, “How are you today?”</p>
			<p>“Just marvelous! And you sir?” She had a radiant smile upon her face.</p>
			<p>“I am fine. Might I add, what a beautiful trinket you have there.”</p>
			<p>He was looking at a small amulet of polished purple stone, bound in gold, hanging from a golden chain around her neck.</p>
			<p>“Thank you. It was a present from Papa.”</p>
			<p>“It is an early birthday present. It makes me glad to see her wear it,” Chamberlain clarified.</p>
			<p>“It used to be my mother’s. It reminds me of her.” She looked down while clutching the stone in her palm.</p>
			<p>“Well,” said Gremmert, “it suits you, Miss, and congratulations.” He looked to Mr. Chamberlain “We better get going, lots of preparations to make. Thank you for your time.” He then looked to Robert. “It has been a pleasure to meet you, Robert Vander. I hope this isn’t the last time we cross paths.”</p>
			<p>As he went to twist the door knob, Robert started, “If I can speak for myself, I truly can’t thank you two enough, for saving my life and taking care of me. I wish there was some way I could repay you.”</p>
			<p>“Just make a life for yourself worth saving.” At those words Gremmert turned around swiftly and walked through the door, Ezekiel followed behind. Robert felt sad to see them go, the first people he met since coming to, the only ones attached to his new identity had as swiftly separated from him. With so much change in the last hours, he would think it better not to cling on to anything with hopes of keeping it. He felt that anything like such would soon be unrooted.</p>
			<p>“Robert… Robert, are you okay?” Mr. Chamberlain was looking toward Robert worriedly.</p>
			<p>“I-I’m fine, just lost in thought, is all.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’ve changed my mind. You don’t have to wait for me to finish here. You can go on ahead with my daughter. She can lead you to the house. Could you do that for me dear?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly Papa”, she said in response, still smiling. “We’ll see you soon.”</p>
			<p>“I won’t be long,” said the Wharf Master, as he walked back behind his desk. He began to finger through some of the papers. The two youth left the room, and closed the door behind them. He picked up the pen, dipped it in the ink and began to scratch black letters onto a blank piece of parchment.</p>
