			<p>On my mission, I would keep objects on my desk that I could manipulate while I studied. This included such things as a Rubik's Cube, a fidget spinner, and a pocket maze. The object I used the most, however, was a kneaded eraser. It is good at carefully removing charcoal from paper, though it can also be used for erasing pencil. I did not use it for erasing very often though, but I would mold it between my fingers and shape it. One of these days, I twisted it in two, and pressed one half flush to the table. It looked like a peaked island to me. Then I imagined the other piece being another landmass suspended above the first. They became Asterion and Alterra, respectively. This sparked thoughts about what a place such as this would be like. Once I began asking questions about why it was like that and what would people be like if they lived there, I began sketching and taking notes. Linked above are the first three chapters of the world that sprung from these thoughts. They are by no means polished writing, but I enjoyed writing it and hope you enjoy them as well.</p>
