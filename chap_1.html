			<p>I am not sure of your opinion of fate, but I believe nothing happens randomly,  or without reason. All of the choices we make, big or small, have an impact on where we are going and who we become.</p>
			<p>Some believe that individuality does not exist within the parameters of fate and prophecy. Therefore, what someone becomes was meant to be and was predetermined, regardless of their choice or opinion.</p>
			<p>I believe these prophetic declarations give an idea of our potential, and act as lighthouses on the distant shore. The captain decides if he will acknowledge the light and follow it to safety or find his own way.</p>
			<p>Thus, our agency becomes an inevitable factor to us gaining favor from any prophecy. Choose right and receive the promises; choose wrong and receive a curse rather than a blessing.</p>
			<p>If you open your mind, imagine you are soaring through the air above an expansive ocean, just below the clouds. The salty breeze fills your nose. Look down below, drifting through the sea spread before you, there is a young lad, about fifteen years-old. Although he lies unconscious, his story will start to unfold. For our friend here, the events which will transpire are not mere happenstance, but the effects of choices brought together by the binding agent of fate.</p>
			<p>We all encounter forks in our road one time or another, which change our course. Though he might not know it yet, as he lies face down on a piece of floating debris, soaked in briny water, and drifting through the current, fate has grabbed our friend , and set him on a course to become more than he will soon realize.</p>
			<p>A few, however, will attempt to prevent and persuade our hero from making the best decisions. Fortunately, friendship will prove an invaluable asset. The better the choice, the nobler the outcome, and luckily these outcomes are best enjoyed with good company. You will serve as my witness to this.</p>
			<p>The sound of something heavy crashing against the surface of the sea broke the usual maritime monotony. A large ship, a shipping vessel, approached with the inscription <em>‘Alvorada’</em> on the aft side. She came from a distant country, to carry cargo to an island opened to trade only a few years prior.</p>
			<p>Speaking of alvorada, the sun was just rising, filling the sky with vibrant orange and yellow light, and painting the white sails in a similar manner. The beams had to peek through the sharp, spear-like jetties, growing more and more distant, to reach the captain of <em>The Alvorada</em>. He stood on the upper deck, giving order to hoist up the boy. To his crew that looked up at him he was a tall, dark figure, whose features were silhouetted by the radiant light behind him. He went swiftly down the staircase to the ship’s edge when the young man’s limp body was placed on deck.</p>
			<p>“Hm,” said the captain, “He’s still breathing, but took quite a beating. Put him in the cabin below. Ezekiel, watch over him. Let me know when he wakes up.”</p>
			<p>Though his voice was stern and rough, his concern for the boy was clear. The Captain parted and went to his own quarters. His orders were directed to his first mate, an older, yet sturdy man with a short graying beard, who promptly obeyed and descended to the lower levels of <em>The Alvorada</em>, the boy cradled in his arms.</p>
			<p>She sped ahead with full sails towards the island which remained uncharted for hundreds of years. The sky behind it was filled with dense storm clouds which had scourged the area the night before. The island was constituted primarily of a conical mountain, speared on top with an enormous white spire. However, what makes this scene even more of a spectacle was the second island suspended immediately above its sea-bound sister. Similar white structures were erected underneath and on top. It appeared as though paused in mid-air, anxious to fall, yet completely motionless.</p>
			<p>The only thing that agitated the scenery was a set of clear waterfalls plummeting to the earth, cheated from the chance to defy gravity. As they fell they framed the lower island and cast a fine mist around her which refracted light in a beautiful array of colors.</p>
			<p>When they were finally just a few hundred yards from the wharf, someone knocked on the Captain’s door.</p>
			<p>“Come in!” said the Captain. His desk was covered with piles of reports, logs, and sea charts. As he remained rummaging through them he asked, “What is it?”</p>
			<p>“It's the boy, sir. He’s awake.” Ezekiel had a placid expression on his face, being relieved that the boy was fortunate enough to survive.</p>
			<p>“Has he said anything yet?”</p>
			<p>"No, Sir"</p>
			<p>“Alright, make sure he is fed, and clothed. As soon as I am done here, I would like to speak with him and find out what he can remember. Make sure he is ready, because he will be accompanying us off ship. I will be there shortly.”</p>
			<p>Ezekiel noticed this as his cue to leave. As he stepped out, and closed the door behind him, the Captain opened up the top drawer of his cluttered desk and removed a small metallic object which fit in the palm of his hand. He weighed it carefully, deep in thought, before replacing it and continuing to evaluate the papers.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The ringing in the lad’s ears died down enough to allow him to hear the approaching footsteps of his caretaker. He was swinging in a canvas hammock, rocking with the ship. His clothes had dried, but the salty water turned them into stiff plaster-like garments. Ezekiel came, arms laden with fresh clothes: a large shirt, a pair of tattered trousers, and boots. The young man noticed the front of them peeling up, revealing the well-worn insoles.</p>
			<p>“These clothes are nothin’ much, but they’ll keep ya from gettin’ splinters in yer feet an’ blisters on yer back.”</p>
			<p>Ezekiel laid the items on the boys lap. “I’ll be back, just’ll go fetch somethin’ fer you to eat.”</p>
			<p>When Ezekiel left, the ringing in the young man’s ears returned and brought a throbbing headache with it. His physical exhaustion was matched with a mental fatigue, which prevented him from maintaining any clear thought as to what happened to him, or where he was at the moment.</p>
			<p>A few minutes later the man returned with an apple in hand and a small loaf of bread. “Yer probly starvin’. Eat up, laddy.”</p>
			<p>After he finished the last morsel, Ezekiel said, “The Captain wishes to speak to yeh. Better change into yer new clothes, before he comes down. He’ll be here soon.”</p>
			<p>The boy did as he was told and discarded his old clothes. First he put on the shirt which fell to his knees. He rolled up the sleeves to keep his hands free. The trousers kept falling down, so he started tying a cord around his waist to be a makeshift belt, when a tall man, with a dark beard and large hat, came to him. The man went down to one knee to be eye-level with the boy, sitting in the hammock.</p>
			<p>“How are you feeling?”, asked the Captain. A simple question, and one reasonable enough to answer.</p>
			<p>“Rather lousy, actually” the boy’s voice strained because of the sore lump in his throat. Ezekiel looked rather shocked to hear him speak, but the Captain wore a pleased, half smile.</p>
			<p>The Captain wished to inquire further: “That was some storm last night, how do you believe you ended up washed away as we found you? What happened?”</p>
			<p>“I don't know, I can't remember. My mind, it's all… foggy. I can’t remember a thing.”</p>
			<p>“That is unfortunate, I’m sure it will come back to you, my promise. Well, wherever you came from, you are now here with us. We are approaching Asterion, an island. I would like you to accompany me and my first mate on shore, so we can provide you with some more help. We should be docking in a few minutes, so make yourself ready.”</p>
			<p>The Captain turned around and was about to head back up to his quarters when the boy asked, “Wait, who are you? What’s your name?”</p>
			<p>The tall man twisted enough to look the boy in the eye. “My name is Archibald Gremmert, I’m the captain of this dear sea craft,” he said as he spread out his arms, gesturing at the ship around them. “And you, what’s your name young man?”</p>
			<p>“R-Robert Vander.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Mr. Vander, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
He bowed slightly, then swirled around, his dark cloak clawing at the air around him.</p>
			<p>Robert had never been called Mr. Vander before. At least, he could not recall any instance where he was.</p>
