			<p>Gremmert could tell from the height of the sun that it was about nine o’clock in the morning. This was confirmed a few seconds later when a large bell struck several times above the town’s busy port. <em>The Alvorada</em> pulled up against her designated dock. One crew member threw  a heavy cord overboard to the local workers. Others ran to the prow to lower the cast-iron anchors. Even more grabbed  pronged shafts to pry open the floor panels to reveal the cargo bay beneath the deck. A huge crane swung over to assist in hoisting out crates and began the unloading process. The elegant vessel became a small part of the even greater bustle of daily commerce and trade.</p>
			<p>As soon as the plank touched the steady boardwalk below, the Captain, with his first mate and Robert following behind him, walked down. When the boy stepped foot on the platform, he stumbled, being caught by Ezekiel.</p>
			<p>“Opa! Watch yer step, laddy. Gotta be more careful. I should’ve told yeh to leave yer sea legs on board. Yeh won't be needin’ them here. Hahahahaha! This floor don’t sway.”</p>
			<p>Robert gave a half-hearted smile and a deflected laugh in response.</p>
			<p>“Sorry ‘bout the humor, laddy, didn’ mean the make fun a yeh.”</p>
			<p>“It’s fine. It was actually kind of clever. Also, your right. For some reason, I feel like I haven't been on land in a long time.”</p>
			<p>Robert did not want Ezekiel to feel he was offended, but felt the first mate became discouraged because he spoke few words afterwards. He tried to warm up to his rescuers. The captain with the wide-brimmed hat was reserved, but respectful. His eyes were kind, meriting anyone’s trust, yet piercing, as if to extract anyone’s deepest secrets, although with his head throbbing, Robert could not remember last night’s events, let alone if he had any secrets to keep.</p>
			<p>As they navigated the busy streets, he found he was crutching on the first mate’s shoulder. He was short and a handful of years older than Gremmert, by appearances. He had given the most immediate care. Robert’s dizziness indicated he was still recovering. He felt embarrassed to be unable to walk on his own. Perhaps he could find himself a good walking stick.</p>
			<p>The trio wandered from pier to pier, moving inland past signs and windows, until they reached a huge edifice which held the bell in a tall clock tower. Most of the buildings in the city were no more than two stories. This structure, however, rose above them all. Besides spanning an entire block, it was twice the height of the surrounding homesteads and establishments, without mention of the tower. The facade was breached by rows of windows on the upper levels.</p>
			<p>The left side, to someone approaching the front, was a warehouse, which occupied most of the property. Lamp posts were placed every hundred feet or so. About as frequent, were stationed guards. One was on either side of the large dark wood door. They wore vibrant blue uniforms, which stood out against the warmer and subtler tones of the populace and architecture.</p>
			<p>Robert was guided through the doorway, past the azure statues keeping watch. By this time, Robert was able to walk on his own. Gremmert motioned to Ezekiel and Robert to wait while he approached one of the clerks, sitting behind one of several wood-carved desks. They were linked together by wooden podiums decorated with ornate scrolls which blossomed on top into beautiful lilies. Each flower held a brazen lamp, which would have illuminated the otherwise dark environment, had the morning sun not been shining through the front windows, or the radial skylight above.</p>
			<p>Although the roar from outside, generated by the yelling salesmen and accusing drunkards was discombobulating, the rushing noise inside was no less overwhelming. Each hushed whisper accumulated and multiplied off the polished stone walls, creating a massive wave that crashed against Robert’s eardrums. The constant pattering of feet of clerks and businessmen transformed into a steady rumble undertoning the cacophonous tide of negotiations.</p>
			<p>“I know all this can be disorienting, but you’ll get used to it.” Gremmert had returned. He wore a kind smile, his hat was in his hands to reveal a head of dark curly hair. “Come on, let’s get going. The Wharf Master is a busy man, we should not keep him waiting,” he said, leading them toward one of two elegant staircases.</p>
			<p>The young man imagined where they were heading. He also tried to picture “the Wharf Master” in his mind. Why did they need to see him? He pretended to see a large bulbous man, with fingers covered in jeweled rings, waving a servant to fetch his next appetizer, when they arrived at the top-most floor.</p>
			<p>Noticing the number of steps required to get up there destroyed the notion Robert had of a rotund chief. Even , young as he was, Robert was drained by the vertical expedition.</p>
			<p>Robert looked through a skylight to see several white birds playing in the last morning rays of the sun. He turned around, opposite the railing, to see a wall with a row of windows. However, they did not lead outside, but opened up to the large warehouse. There was row upon row of shelves laden with stacks and stacks of crates and shipping containers. Adjacent to the windows, one could see a room which cantilevered into the warehouse, recognizable at once as the Master’s office.</p>
			<p>The door was simple and had a plaque with gold lettering which read <em>Preston Chamberlain, Wharf Master</em>. On either side stood two more of those blue suited men. As they approached, one of them rapped his knuckles gently on the door.</p>
			<p>Gremmert leaned over and whispered, “unless he asks any questions, Mr. Vander, let me do the talking. You have nothing to worry about.”</p>
			<p>Robert was perfectly fine letting the captain speak. Though he did not know why, Robert felt nervous meeting the Master. Gremmert’s words assured him everything would turn out alright.</p>
			<p>Before they even reached the door, it opened from the inside.</p>
